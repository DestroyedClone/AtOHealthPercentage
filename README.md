Shows health percentage of heroes and monsters. Heroes have an additional "Real" health which reflects their health outside of combat.

Made because I wanted to quicker and more easily see when I can end the combat early for full health from Vitality stacking. Enemy HP is for that one aura that restores hp if it reaches <20% and gets hit.
